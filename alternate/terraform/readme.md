Steps to Setup Backend:
Create a Storage Account:

You need to manually create an Azure Storage Account named myterraformstateaccount (or another name, but if you change it, update backend.tf accordingly).
Within this storage account, create a blob container named terraformstate.
Set Up Azure Authentication:

When running Terraform commands locally, the Azure CLI is typically used to authenticate. Make sure you're logged in (az login).
In CI/CD environments, you'll need a Service Principal or other authentication mechanism.
Initialize Terraform with the Backend:

Run terraform init to initialize the backend. This will move any existing local state to the Azure blob storage (if a local state exists).
Note:
Resource Group Name: myTerraformStateRG in backend.tf should exist or be created before running Terraform commands. If you want to manage the Resource Group with Terraform, you'll need a slight modification in the workflow: First, apply Terraform configurations without the backend setup, create necessary resources, then re-initialize Terraform with the backend.

Storage Account Name: Azure Storage Account names are globally unique. You might need to choose a different name if myterraformstateaccount is already taken.

Once the backend is set up and the above steps are done, the Terraform state will be saved in the specified Azure Storage Account after every terraform apply. This setup allows for centralized state management, which is especially beneficial when collaborating with a team or when automating infrastructure deployments.
